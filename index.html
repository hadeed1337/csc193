        <h3>Interesting Topic #1</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.ufc.com/">A topic I find interesting is <strong>Martial Arts</strong>. I enjoy watching UFC and Boxing. My favorite fighter is Khabib because I love how he's not really good at striking or Jiu Jitsu, but he is such an amazing wrestler and grappler that he's been undefeated his whole career. He was so dominant that he never even bled once.</a>
        </p>
	<h3>Intersting Topic #2</h3>
	<p>
	  <a> I also love motorycles and cars. I currently have my motorcycle license but no bike. I eventually want to get an r6, but my ultimate goal for a bike is a Yamaha R1 or a Ducati V4s.</a>
